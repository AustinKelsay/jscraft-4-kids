3. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser

## üéÆ How to Play

### Movement Controls
- **Click the game** to activate mouse look controls
- **Move mouse**: Look around (left/right and up/down)
- **WASD keys** or **arrow keys** to move around the 3D world
- **W/Up Arrow**: Walk forward in the direction you're facing
- **A/Left Arrow**: Strafe left (sidestep left)
- **S/Down Arrow**: Walk backward
- **D/Right Arrow**: Strafe right (sidestep right)
- **Q**: Turn your view left (when not using mouse)
- **E**: Turn your view right (when not using mouse)
- **ESC**: Release mouse control

### Building Controls
- **SPACE**: Jump when moving, or remove the object you're looking at (yellow highlight)
- **B**: Build a new object in front of you
- **0**: Select fists (remove mode)
- **1-3**: Select object type to build (tree, rock, house)
- **4-6**: Select animal type to spawn (cow, pig, horse)

### UI Elements
- **White crosshair** in the center shows where you're looking
- **Compass** in the top-left shows your direction and time of day
- **Object selector** at the bottom shows buildable objects and animals
- **Day/Night cycle**: Watch the sun and moon move across the sky!

### Animals
The game now features three types of animals that wander around the world:
- **üêÑ Cows**: Brown with white spots, simplified box-based design with horns and udders - move slowly with a gentle sway
- **üê∑ Pigs**: Pink with distinctive snouts, clean box-based body design - move at medium speed with a waddle
- **üê¥ Horses**: Dark brown with black manes, elegant design with two-part legs - move quickly with grace

Animals feature clean, recognizable shapes with simple geometry (boxes, cylinders, spheres), properly positioned features, and natural movement animations including walking, idle breathing, and occasional head turns. You can spawn new animals or remove existing ones just like other objects!

## üé® Understanding the Code

### Project Structure
The game consists of three main files:
- **index.html**: The webpage structure with semantic HTML5
- **script.js**: All game logic using Three.js (1900+ lines)
- **style.css**: Responsive styling with mobile support

### Three.js Architecture
This game uses Three.js, a powerful 3D graphics library that makes creating 3D worlds much easier:
- **Scene**: The 3D world containing all objects
- **Camera**: Your viewpoint in the world (PerspectiveCamera for realistic depth)
- **Renderer**: Draws the 3D scene onto the HTML canvas
- **Raycaster**: Detects which objects you're looking at for interaction

### The Player System
```javascript
// Player physics state
const player = {
    velocity: new THREE.Vector3(),  // Movement speed in 3D space
    canJump: true,                  // Whether player can jump
    height: 1.7                     // Eye height in meters
};

// Camera controller for first-person view
const cameraController = {
    yaw: 0,      // Horizontal rotation (left/right looking)
    pitch: 0     // Vertical rotation (up/down looking)
};
```

### World Objects
Objects are created using Three.js geometries and materials:
```javascript
// Example: Creating a tree with Three.js
const tree = new THREE.Group();  // Container for multiple parts
// Trunk: CylinderGeometry with brown material
// Foliage: Multiple ConeGeometry layers with green material
tree.userData = { type: 'tree', removable: true };
```

Objects feature:
- **Multi-layered rendering** for depth and realism
- **Dynamic shading** based on distance and time of day
- **Detailed textures** like bark, foliage clusters, rock facets, and house features

### 3D Graphics with Three.js
Three.js handles the complex 3D math for us:
- **Perspective Projection**: Automatic realistic depth rendering
- **Shadow Mapping**: Dynamic shadows that follow the sun/moon
- **Fog Effects**: Distance-based visibility for performance
- **Lighting System**: DirectionalLight for sun/moon, AmbientLight for base illumination
- **Materials**: PBR (Physically Based Rendering) with MeshStandardMaterial

### The Game Loop
The game runs at 60 FPS using requestAnimationFrame:
```javascript
function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    
    const delta = clock.getDelta();  // Time since last frame
    
    updatePlayer(delta);             // Handle movement and physics
    updateDayNightCycle();           // Move sun/moon, change lighting
    updateAnimals(delta);            // Update animal movement and animations
    updateObjectHighlight();         // Check what player is looking at
    
    renderer.render(scene, camera);  // Draw everything
}
```

### Key Features
- **Mouse Look**: Click to capture mouse for smooth camera control
- **Building System**: Place and remove objects in the world
- **Day/Night Cycle**: 2-minute days and 1-minute nights with moving sun/moon
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Objects and sky change based on celestial positions
- **Object Targeting**: Yellow highlight shows which object you can interact with
- **Realistic Objects**: Trees with multiple foliage layers, procedurally deformed rocks, detailed houses with windows and doors
- **Living Animals**: Cows, pigs, and horses that wander around with simple animations

## üîß Customization Ideas

### Easy Changes - Modify the CONFIG Object
All game settings are in the CONFIG object at the top of `script.js`:
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    player: {
        speed: 10,          // Make walking faster/slower
        lookSpeed: 0.002,   // Mouse sensitivity
        jumpSpeed: 10       // Jump height
    },
    world: {
        size: 1000,         // Playable area size
        fogFar: 500         // View distance
    },
    objects: {
        tree: {
            leavesColor: 0x228B22,  // Change tree color (hex format)
            minHeight: 4,           // Tree size variation
            maxHeight: 8
        },
        cow: {
            bodyColor: 0x8B4513,    // Brown
            moveSpeed: 2,           // How fast they walk
            wanderRadius: 15        // How far they roam
        }
        // Similar configs for pig and horse...
    }
}
```

### Adding More Objects
Find the `createInitialObjects()` function in script.js and add more objects:
```javascript
// Add a new tree at position (x: 50, z: 50)
createTree(50, 50);

// Add multiple rocks in a pattern
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    createRock(i * 10, 20);
}

// Create a house
createHouse(100, 100);

// Create animals
createCow(30, 30);
createPig(-20, 40);
createHorse(60, -50);
```

Objects and animals are automatically added to the world with:
- Shadows enabled
- Collision detection ready (for future implementation)
- Removable by looking at them and pressing SPACE
- Animals have autonomous movement and animations

### Color Codes for Three.js
Three.js uses hexadecimal color format (0x instead of #):
- `0xFF0000` - Red
- `0x00FF00` - Green  
- `0x0000FF` - Blue
- `0xFFFF00` - Yellow
- `0xFF00FF` - Magenta
- `0x00FFFF` - Cyan
- `0xFFA500` - Orange
- `0x800080` - Purple

## üêõ Common Problems and Solutions

### My player doesn't move!
- Check that you copied all the JavaScript code
- Make sure to click on the game canvas to activate it
- The browser console (F12) will show any JavaScript errors

### The movement feels too fast/slow!
- Adjust `CONFIG.player.speed` (default is 10, try 5-20)
- Change `CONFIG.player.lookSpeed` for mouse sensitivity (default 0.002)

### I can't see any objects!
- Objects might be behind you - try turning around
- Check if fog is hiding distant objects - increase `CONFIG.world.fogFar`
- Make sure Three.js loaded properly (check console for errors)

### The game is running slowly!
- Reduce shadow quality: `CONFIG.renderer.shadowMapSize = 1024`
- Decrease the number of objects in the world
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory

### Objects look dark or black!
- Make sure lighting is set up properly in `createLighting()`
- Check that materials have proper color values (0x format)
- Verify shadows are enabled on both lights and objects

### The game doesn't start!
- Check the browser's developer console for errors (F12 key)
- Make sure Three.js CDN link in index.html is working
- Verify you're using a modern browser with WebGL support
