3. Double-click the file to open it in your web browser

## üéÆ How to Play

### Movement Controls
- **Click the game** to activate mouse look controls
- **Move mouse**: Look around (left/right and up/down)
- **WASD keys** or **arrow keys** to move around the 3D world
- **W/Up Arrow**: Walk forward in the direction you're facing
- **A/Left Arrow**: Strafe left (sidestep left)
- **S/Down Arrow**: Walk backward
- **D/Right Arrow**: Strafe right (sidestep right)
- **Q**: Turn your view left (when not using mouse)
- **E**: Turn your view right (when not using mouse)
- **ESC**: Release mouse control

### Building Controls
- **SPACE**: Remove the object you're looking at (yellow highlight)
- **B**: Build a new object in front of you
- **1-3**: Select object type to build (tree, rock, house)

### UI Elements
- **White crosshair** in the center shows where you're looking
- **Compass** in the top-left shows your direction and time of day
- **Object selector** at the bottom shows buildable objects
- **Day/Night cycle**: Watch the sun and moon move across the sky!

## üß† What You're Learning

This template teaches you important programming concepts:

- **3D Perspective Rendering**: Creating the illusion of depth and distance
- **First-Person Camera**: Moving through a world from the player's viewpoint
- **Trigonometry**: Using math to calculate angles and positions
- **Field of View**: Only showing objects that are visible in front of the player
- **Distance-Based Scaling**: Making objects appear larger when close, smaller when far
- **Object Sorting**: Drawing far objects first, near objects last for proper layering
- **Event Listeners**: Making your program respond to keyboard and mouse input
- **Game Loops**: Making things move and update continuously
- **Canvas Drawing**: Creating graphics and animation
- **Pointer Lock API**: Capturing mouse for first-person controls
- **Object Building System**: Creating and destroying world objects
- **Day/Night Cycles**: Dynamic lighting and celestial movement

## üé® Understanding the Code

### The Player Object
```javascript
const player = {
    x: 400,        // Our position in the world (left-right)
    y: 300,        // Our position in the world (forward-back)
    angle: 0,      // Which direction we're facing (in radians)
    pitch: 0,      // Looking up/down angle (in radians)
    speed: 3,      // How fast we walk
    turnSpeed: 0.05 // How fast we turn
};
```

### World Objects
Objects in the world have positions, dimensions, and depth for realistic 3D appearance:
```javascript
// A tree with position, size, depth, and color variations
{x: 200, y: 100, width: 40, height: 120, depth: 40, color: '#228B22', type: 'tree'}
```

Objects feature:
- **Multi-layered rendering** for depth and realism
- **Dynamic shading** based on distance and time of day
- **Detailed textures** like bark, foliage clusters, rock facets, and house features

### 3D Perspective Magic
The key to 3D perspective is calculating how objects should appear based on:
- **Distance**: Closer objects appear larger
- **Angle**: Objects only visible within your field of view  
- **Screen Position**: Where objects appear left/right based on viewing angle
- **Pitch**: Objects move up/down based on your vertical look angle
- **Lighting**: Objects brighten/darken based on time of day

### The Game Loop
The game loop runs about 60 times per second and does these main things:
1. **Update** the player position and rotation based on key presses
2. **Draw** the background (sky gradient and ground gradient)
3. **Draw** all visible world objects with 3D perspective and distance sorting
4. **Draw** UI elements (crosshair and compass)

### Key Features
- **Mouse Look**: Click to capture mouse for smooth camera control
- **Building System**: Place and remove objects in the world
- **Day/Night Cycle**: 2-minute days and 1-minute nights with moving sun/moon
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Objects and sky change based on celestial positions
- **Object Targeting**: Yellow highlight shows which object you can interact with
- **Realistic Objects**: Trees with foliage clusters, faceted rocks, detailed houses

## üéØ Fun Challenges to Try

### Beginner Challenges
1. **Change Colors**: Try changing the sky gradients, ground colors, or object colors
2. **Speed Control**: Make your walking or turning faster or slower
3. **Add Objects**: Create more trees, rocks, or houses in different locations
4. **Object Types**: Design new object types with different shapes and details

### Intermediate Challenges
1. **Collision Detection**: Make it so you can't walk through trees and houses
2. **Enhanced Lighting**: Extend the day/night system with dawn/dusk transitions
3. **Sound Effects**: Add footstep sounds when moving or ambient nature sounds
4. **Weather Effects**: Add rain, snow, or fog that affects visibility
5. **Animated Objects**: Make trees sway or add moving clouds
6. **Build Limits**: Add resource management for building objects
7. **Save/Load**: Save your world creations to local storage

### Advanced Challenges
1. **Larger World**: Create a bigger world with more diverse environments
2. **Quest System**: Add objectives like "find all the houses" or "collect hidden items"
3. **Inventory System**: Let players collect and use items they find
4. **NPCs**: Add other characters that move around or can be talked to
5. **Minimap**: Add a small map showing your position and nearby objects
6. **Procedural Generation**: Create random worlds each time you play

## üîß Customization Ideas

### Easy Changes
- **Sky Colors**: Change the gradient colors in `drawBackground()` for different times of day
- **Object Colors**: Modify tree (`#228B22`), rock (`#696969`), or house (`#D2691E`) colors
- **World Bounds**: Adjust the player boundary limits to make the explorable area bigger
- **Movement Speed**: Change `speed: 3` to make walking faster or slower
- **Turn Speed**: Change `turnSpeed: 0.05` to make looking around faster or slower
- **Add More Objects**: Copy existing objects in the `worldObjects` array and change their positions

### Color Codes You Can Use
- `#FF0000` - Red
- `#00FF00` - Green  
- `#0000FF` - Blue
- `#FFFF00` - Yellow
- `#FF00FF` - Magenta
- `#00FFFF` - Cyan
- `#FFA500` - Orange
- `#800080` - Purple

## üêõ Common Problems and Solutions

### My player doesn't move!
- Check that you copied all the JavaScript code
- Make sure the canvas has focus (click on it first)
- Verify that both WASD and arrow key event listeners are included

### The movement feels too fast/slow!
- Change the `speed` value in the player object (try values between 1-10)
- Change the `turnSpeed` value for faster/slower looking around

### I can't see any objects!
- Objects might be behind you - try turning around with Q/E keys
- Check that object colors aren't the same as the background
- Objects have a maximum render distance - try moving closer

### The 3D effect doesn't look right!
- Make sure the `fieldOfView` calculation is working correctly
- Check that objects are being sorted by distance (far to near)
- Verify the perspective scaling math in `drawWorldObjects()`

### The game doesn't start!
- Check the browser's developer console for errors (F12 key)
- Make sure all brackets `{}` and parentheses `()` match up
- Ensure all semicolons `;` are in place

## üìö Learning Resources

### Next Steps
- Learn about collision detection (preventing walking through objects)
- Explore texture mapping to add realistic surfaces to objects
- Study lighting and shadow effects for more immersive environments
- Research audio integration for sound effects and music
- Learn about 3D math and vector calculations for advanced effects

## üéâ You Did It!

Congratulations! You now have a working first-person 3D exploration game that you built yourself. You can walk around a world, see objects with realistic perspective, and navigate using first-person controls just like in professional games. This is an excellent foundation for learning game development! Keep experimenting, keep learning, and most importantly, keep having fun!

Remember: Every expert was once a beginner. You're already on your way to becoming a great programmer! üåü
