# üéÆ JSCraft First-Person Starter Template for Kids

Welcome to your first JavaScript first-person exploration game! This template gives you everything you need to start building awesome first-person adventures where you see the world through your character's eyes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Using Replit
1. Go to [Replit.com](https://replit.com)
2. Create a new HTML/CSS/JS project
3. Copy and paste the code from the HTML template into your `index.html` file
4. Click the "Run" button to see your game!

### Option 2: Using Your Computer
1. Create a new file called `index.html`
2. Copy and paste the template code into this file
3. Double-click the file to open it in your web browser

## üéÆ How to Play

- Use **WASD keys** or **arrow keys** to move around the world
- **W/Up Arrow**: Move forward (north)
- **A/Left Arrow**: Move left (west)  
- **S/Down Arrow**: Move backward (south)
- **D/Right Arrow**: Move right (east)
- Look at the **white crosshair** in the center - that's your view direction
- Check the **mini-map** in the top-right corner to see where you are
- Explore the world and discover trees, rocks, and flowers!

## üß† What You're Learning

This template teaches you important programming concepts:

- **Camera Systems**: Creating a first-person view that follows the player
- **World Coordinates**: Managing a world larger than the screen
- **Object Arrays**: Storing and managing multiple game objects
- **Viewport Culling**: Only drawing objects that are visible on screen
- **UI Overlays**: Adding interface elements like crosshairs and mini-maps
- **Event Listeners**: Making your program respond to keyboard input
- **Game Loops**: Making things move and update continuously
- **Conditionals**: Making decisions in your code (if statements)
- **Canvas Drawing**: Creating graphics and animation

## üé® Understanding the Code

### The Camera System
```javascript
const camera = {
    x: 0,          // Our position in the world (left-right)
    y: 0,          // Our position in the world (up-down)  
    speed: 4       // How fast we move through the world
};
```

### World Objects
Objects in the world have fixed positions, but appear to move as our camera moves:
```javascript
// An object at position 200,150 in world coordinates
{x: 200, y: 150, width: 60, height: 80, color: '#228B22', type: 'tree'}
```

### First-Person View Magic
The key to first-person view is subtracting the camera position from object positions:
```javascript
const screenX = obj.x - camera.x;  // Where to draw on screen
const screenY = obj.y - camera.y;  // Where to draw on screen
```

### The Game Loop
The game loop runs about 60 times per second and does these main things:
1. **Update** the camera position based on key presses
2. **Draw** the background/ground
3. **Draw** all visible world objects in their screen positions
4. **Draw** UI elements (crosshair, mini-map)

### Key Controls
The game listens for both WASD and arrow keys, making it accessible for different play styles. Both control schemes work the same way.

## üéØ Fun Challenges to Try

### Beginner Challenges
1. **Change Colors**: Try changing the tree colors or background colors
2. **Speed Control**: Make your movement faster or slower
3. **Add Objects**: Create more trees, rocks, or flowers in different locations
4. **Crosshair Style**: Change the crosshair color or make it bigger

### Intermediate Challenges
1. **Collision Detection**: Make it so you can't walk through trees and rocks
2. **New Object Types**: Add houses, lakes, or mountains to explore
3. **Sound Effects**: Add footstep sounds when moving
4. **Day/Night Cycle**: Make the sky color change over time
5. **Weather Effects**: Add rain or snow animations

### Advanced Challenges
1. **Multiple Levels**: Create different areas to explore (forest, desert, city)
2. **Moving Objects**: Add animals or vehicles that move around
3. **Quest System**: Create objectives like "find 5 flowers"
4. **Inventory System**: Let players collect and use items
5. **NPCs**: Add other characters to talk to
6. **3D Effect**: Add perspective scaling to make distant objects smaller

## üîß Customization Ideas

### Easy Changes
- **Background Colors**: Change `#87CEEB` (sky) and `#90EE90` (grass) to any colors you like
- **Object Colors**: Change tree (`#228B22`), rock (`#696969`), or flower (`#FF69B4`) colors
- **World Size**: Modify `width: 2000, height: 1500` to make the world bigger or smaller
- **Movement Speed**: Change `speed: 4` to make movement faster or slower
- **Add More Objects**: Copy existing objects in `worldObjects` array and change their x,y positions

### Color Codes You Can Use
- `#FF0000` - Red
- `#00FF00` - Green  
- `#0000FF` - Blue
- `#FFFF00` - Yellow
- `#FF00FF` - Magenta
- `#00FFFF` - Cyan
- `#FFA500` - Orange
- `#800080` - Purple

## üêõ Common Problems and Solutions

### My camera doesn't move!
- Check that you copied all the JavaScript code
- Make sure the canvas has focus (click on it first)
- Verify that both WASD and arrow key event listeners are included

### The movement feels too fast/slow!
- Change the `speed` value in the camera object
- Smaller numbers = slower movement
- Larger numbers = faster movement

### I can't see any objects!
- Objects might be outside your starting view - try moving around
- Check that object colors aren't the same as the background
- Make sure objects have positive width and height values

### The mini-map doesn't show my position!
- Check that the world width and height values are set correctly
- Verify the camera x,y positions are being updated
- Make sure the mini-map drawing code is included

### The game doesn't start!
- Check the browser's developer console for errors (F12 key)
- Make sure all brackets `{}` and parentheses `()` match up
- Ensure all semicolons `;` are in place

## üìö Learning Resources

### Next Steps
- Learn about collision detection (preventing walking through objects)
- Explore sprite-based graphics instead of simple rectangles
- Study lighting and shadow effects for more realism
- Research procedural world generation techniques
- Learn about 3D perspective and depth simulation

## üéâ You Did It!

Congratulations! You now have a working first-person exploration game that you built yourself. You can walk around a world, see objects from your character's perspective, and navigate using a mini-map. This is just the beginning of your game development journey! Keep experimenting, keep learning, and most importantly, keep having fun!

Remember: Every expert was once a beginner. You're already on your way to becoming a great programmer! üåü
